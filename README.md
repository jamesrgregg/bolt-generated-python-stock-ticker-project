## Demo 
We want to demo a developer flow using a modern AI solution such as Bolt.diy where the AI bot can look at a repo, inventory the code and create a workflow that does the following:
 - inventory
 - source code checkout
 - set up a build environment
 - build
 - test
 - scan
 - create an SBOM
 - create the attestation for SLSA Level3
 - push artifacts
 - package the application (containerize the software)
 - release the package as a versioned artifact

 Example Diagram of this pipeline can be found [here](https://github.com/arena-si-devops/docs/blob/main/DevOps-Best-Practice/ai-advanced-pipeline.md)
